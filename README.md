### Working with AWS as the provider.

* Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. Terraform can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions. 
* Terraform is written in a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON with a .tf extension.
* It has similar syntax no matter the provider. It is one of the main advantages points of Terraform.
